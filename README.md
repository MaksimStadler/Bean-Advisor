# Bean Advisor
A program that suggests the type and quantity of beans you should consume.

This program makes decisions based on weather patterns in your area and prescribes a measured helping of a specific type of bean.

Discalimer: This program is a joke and is not in any way qualified to recommend any modifications to your diet. Beans; however, are cool and good.
